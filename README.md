Nora, Marko, Steve and Ewelina's blog.

## Project overview
Create a blog to record our progress during Founders and Coders.

## Objectives
- Choose a totally radical team name
- Discuss what pages and features you want your website to have
- Think about what you want your web page to look like 0- fee free to take inspiration from other sites
- If you have time try drawing out wireframes of your page - it's OK to design parts that won't function as well as elements that might enhance your user's experience. Try to think about how it might break or annoy a user.

## First steps
- Everybody to research into blogs that they like to find inspiration for design and features
  - Do we want everything in one page, or several pages?
- Think about who will be using our website
  - Other people looking to learn coding in future
  - Future employers
  - People who want to apply for Founders and Coders
- Think about the user experience
- What content do we want to include? (static/dynamic)
  - Individual profiles with links to social media/Linkedin/Github profiles
  - Intro/About us page
  - Portfolio - to show off things we've built in CodePen, etc
  - Resources - helpful learning materials, etc
  - Automatic Twitter feed? (Not a priority)
